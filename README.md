# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
# 📊 Customer Behavior Analysis  
### *Python • PostgreSQL • Power BI • EDA • Data Cleaning • DAX*

## ⭐ Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior using an end-to-end data analytics workflow.  
I used **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Power BI** to clean data, explore trends, and build an interactive dashboard showing meaningful customer insights.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Understand customer buying patterns and preferences  
- Identify high-performing products and sales trends  
- Segment customers based on behavior  
- Build visual dashboards for decision-making  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **PostgreSQL** (SQL queries, joins, aggregation functions)  
- **Power BI** (DAX, data modeling, interactive visuals)

## 🔧 Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Storage  
- Imported raw sales and customer data into **PostgreSQL**  
- Created tables, relationships, and applied constraints  
- Performed initial cleaning using SQL queries  

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning (Python & SQL)  
- Removed missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues  
- Converted data types (dates, numeric fields, categories)  
- Validated data quality using SQL checks  

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analyzed customer segments, product demand, peak buying hours  
- Identified average spend patterns and repeat purchasing  
- Visualized trends using Python plots  

### 4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard  
- Connected cleaned PostgreSQL tables to Power BI  
- Created **DAX measures** for KPIs (Total Sales, Avg Order Value, Customer Count, Repeat Rate)  
- Designed dashboards for:  
  - Customer segmentation  
  - Product performance  
  - Time-based sales trends  
  - Revenue contribution

## 📌 Key Insights  
- Top-performing products and categories  
- Seasonal or monthly spikes in customer activity  
- Customer groups contributing most to revenue  
- Average purchase value and frequency  
- Patterns that help improve customer retention strategies
